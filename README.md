## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1. **Update `site-config.json`**
   - Located at the project root.
   - Replace placeholder values with your own site details.
   - Top-level fields include:
     - `name`: Display name for the site owner.
     - `tagline`: Short tagline shown on the homepage hero section.
     - `typedItems`: Array of phrases for the homepage typing animation.
     - `about`: Blurb for the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section on the home page.
     - `social`: Links for social media icons (keys: `bluesky`, `twitter`, `google_scholar`, `github`, `linkedin`).
     - `contact`: Email addresses shown in the navigation footer (`academic`, `industry`).
     - `analyticsId`: Google Analytics ID (e.g., `G-XXXXXXXXXX`). Remove this field to disable tracking.
   - Example:
   ```jsonc
   {
     // Display name for the site owner
     "name": "Jane Doe",
     // Short tagline shown on the homepage hero section
     "tagline": "Data Scientist",
     // Short blurb for the About section on the home page
     "about": "I explore data-driven solutions to social problems.",
     "typedItems": ["Scientist", "Teacher"],
     // Social media profile links. Remove a URL to hide its icon.
     "social": {
       "bluesky": "https://bsky.app/profile/example.bsky.social",
       "twitter": "https://twitter.com/example",
       "google_scholar": "https://scholar.google.com/",
       "github": "https://github.com/example",
       "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/example/"
     },
     // Contact email addresses displayed in the navigation footer
     "contact": {
       "academic": "academic@example.edu",
       "industry": "industry@example.com"
     },
     "analyticsId": "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
   }
   ```
   - `site-config.json` supports `//` comments for readability. Tools that require strict JSON may fail to parse these comments; remove them or use a friendlier format like YAML and convert back to JSON before deployment.

2. **Replace images and data**
   - Swap images in `assets/img/` with your own files.
   - Replace `assets/uploads/database.csv` with your data while keeping the header row.

3. **Add resources**
   - Edit `assets/data/resources.json` to manage entries shown on `resources.html`.
   - Each item requires a `title`, `description`, and `link`. Optional fields like `meta`, `type`, or `embed` add extra details or custom layouts.
   - Example:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "title": "Example Resource",
         "description": "Short summary of the resource.",
         "link": "https://example.com",
         "meta": "Optional extra info",
         "type": "whimsical",
         "embed": "https://whimsical.com/embed/example"
       }
     ]
     ```

4. **Preview locally**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the site.

### Common mistakes

- Missing quotes or trailing commas in `site-config.json` (especially after removing comments).
- Renaming images without updating their paths in the HTML/CSS.
- Removing the header row from `database.csv`.
